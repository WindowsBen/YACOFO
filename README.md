## Setup

### 1. Open the Configurator

Visit the **[main website>](windowsben.github.io/soundlist)** — you'll land on the configuration page directly. No account, no install, nothing to download.

> A custom domain is coming soon.

### 2. Log in with Twitch

Click **Login with Twitch**. This opens Twitch's OAuth flow and grants the overlay read-only access to your channel data. The token is stored only in your browser's URL — it is never sent to any server other than Twitch's own API.

**Scopes requested:**

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user:read:chat` | Connect to IRC and read chat messages |
| `channel:read:redemptions` | Receive channel point redemptions via PubSub |
| `channel:read:polls` | Receive live poll data via PubSub |
| `channel:read:predictions` | Receive live prediction data via PubSub |
| `channel:read:hype_train` | Receive hype train events via PubSub |

> All scopes are **read-only**. This overlay cannot post messages, moderate users, or make any changes to your channel.

### 3. Configure

Work through the tabs:

- **General** — channel name, message appearance, timing, filtering, font
- **Events** — enable/disable each event type and customise colours and labels
- **Polls / Predictions / Hype Train** — enable widgets and customise colours
- **Appearance** — badge settings and third-party cosmetics

The **Live Preview** panel on the right updates in real time as you change any setting.

### 4. Generate and Copy the URL

Switch to the **Generate** tab and click **Generate Link**. Copy the resulting URL.

> Whenever you change a setting, the Generate tab will flash to remind you to regenerate your link.

### 5. Add to OBS

1. In OBS, add a new **Browser Source**
2. Paste the generated URL into the URL field
3. Set width and height to match your canvas (e.g. 1920 × 1080)
4. Check **Refresh browser when scene becomes active** (optional but recommended)

## Self-Hosting

The overlay is entirely static files with no build step, so you can host it anywhere.

1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages on the `main` branch (root) in your repo settings
3. Update the Twitch OAuth redirect URI in `config/auth.js` to point to your own URL
4. Everything else works as-is

## Privacy

- Your Twitch OAuth token lives **only in the OBS browser source URL** and your local browser session. It is never transmitted to any server other than `api.twitch.tv`.
- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind.
- No backend — the overlay is 100% static files.
- Third-party emote and badge data is fetched directly from 7TV, BTTV, FFZ, and Chatterino's own public APIs at load time.
